If you still can't get it to work, then it is probably a bug.\n\n§bIt says you must have the nessecary requirements to (remotely) loot this grave. What are the requirements?\n§fBy default, there are no requirements to loot graves and is impossible to remotely loot graves. Take a look at the Requirements config. If there are no requirements or if the requirements should have been met, then this is probably a bug.\n\n§bWhat the hell is ICD?\n§fBy default, when you sneak near a grave, the grave model changes and shows items stored inside the grave one by one and the text display changes and shows info about the item being shown. It cycles through items in the grave (like items in a vault) and even lets you pick up that specific item from the grave. This cool feature is called ICD (Item Cycle Display). Try it yourself!"\

It's annoying me!\n\n§fThis issue is mostly because of Minecraft, because after 1.21.6 it asks for confirmation everytime you click on a text that executes a command with a permission level of 2 or higher. HyperGrave has nothing to do with this issue and it happens for all data packs. Here are some workarounds:\n\n§7•§f If you're using one of Fabric or Quilt mod loaders, you can find some mods that disable this feature.\n§7•§f If you're using the Neoforge mod loader, you don't need to do anything! Neoforge already disables this feature, which is really convenient!\n§7•§f You can press Tab + Space each time after pressing a button, to quickly confirm without moving the cursor."\
